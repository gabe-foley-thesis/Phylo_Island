# Installation

You can try Phylo Island out in a docker instance. This will setup the Mongo database and the Flask application.

git clone github.com/gabe-foley-thesis/PhyloIsland
docker-compose up

You can now open a web browser and enter - 

Inputs required are a phylogenetic tree labelled with ancestral node positions (Newick format) and two sets of ancestor sequences from different prediction methods / settings that correspond to the labelled ancestral node positions (FASTA format). 

See /files/test_6_1.aln, test_6_2.aln, and test_6.nwk for the expected format.
